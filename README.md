## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **road crash data from Victoria, Australia**, combining data from **Victoria Police** and **hospital injury reports**. The aim is to uncover critical patterns in crash severity, timing, contributing factors, and geographic hotspots to support **data-driven policymaking and road safety improvements**.

This interactive dashboard was created using **Tableau Desktop’s Storyboard feature** as part of the – Descriptive Analytics and Visualisation assignment.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify when and where crashes most commonly occur
- Explore how weather, time, vehicle type, and speed zones influence accident severity
- Provide insights and recommendations to reduce road accident frequency and impact

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 🔹 Dashboard 1: Accident Trends and Severity
- **Geographical Spread**: Crashes are dense in metropolitan Melbourne but fatal crashes are more common in regional Victoria.
- **Time of Day**: Accident frequency peaks between **3 PM to 6 PM**, suggesting a link with school pickups and rush hour.
- **Monthly Trends**: Accidents are slightly higher in **summer months**, possibly due to increased road activity and holiday travel.
- **Severity Patterns**: Non-injury and minor injury accidents are more frequent, but **serious and fatal accidents cluster in specific high-risk zones.**

### 🔹 Dashboard 2: Contributing Factors to Crashes
- **Vehicle Type**: Cars are involved in the vast majority of crashes, followed by motorcycles. Trucks and unknown vehicles also contribute but with more severe outcomes.
- **Accident Types**: Most crashes involve **vehicle-to-vehicle collisions**, followed by pedestrians and single-vehicle incidents.
- **Alcohol & Speed Zones**: Speed zones of **50 km/h** and **60 km/h** show the highest number of crashes, including many involving **alcohol**.
- **Time of Day**: Crash frequency remains fairly high in **afternoons and evenings**, with a noticeable drop at night.

## 📌 Visualisation Techniques Used

Each visual was carefully designed using Tableau best practices:

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Colour** | Encodes severity levels (e.g., red for fatal, green for minor injury) |
| **Map** | Identifies geographic crash clusters visually |
| **Stacked bar charts** | Breaks down crash types by vehicle categories |
| **Line and area charts** | Show trends over time (months, hours) |
| **Interactivity** | Filters and hover-tooltips allow deeper exploration of specific segments |

These techniques enhance comprehension and support decision-making for road authorities and public safety bodies.
